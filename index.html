Let him go. Let him go. Doc. You heard her she said get your meat hooks, off, uh please. I noticed you band is on the roster for dance auditions after school today. Why even bother Mcfly, you haven't got a chance, you're too much like your own man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley.

            I'm telling the truth, Doc, you gotta believe me. Marty, such a nice name. He's your brother, Mom. Marty, one rejection isn't the end of the world. Look me up when you get there, guess I'll be about 47.
